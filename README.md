# Mouse-in-a-Maze
A simple Program of a Mouse in a Maze using Backtracking.

We have a maze of size NxN.
The source is [0][0] whereas destination is [N-1][N-1].
In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination. 
###### This is a simple version of the typical Maze problem.
